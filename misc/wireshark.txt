===== DAYTIME =====
1. 1  192.168.124.128  129.6.15.28  TCP  [SYN]  53280->13  Seq=0
   2  129.6.15.28  192.168.124.128  TCP  [SYN,ACK]  13->53280  Seq=0  Ack=1
   3  192.168.124.128  129.6.15.28  TCP  [ACK]  53280->13  Seq=1  Ack=1

2. The client uses 53280 as the port number for this interaction. The client needs a port number since the server would send back protocals to the client and port number    is required in order to find the correct piece of software for receiving information.

4. Daytime Protocol
      Type: Respons
      Daytime: \n59672 22-04-03 15:21:32 50 0 0 721.9 UTC(NIST) * \n
   In this frame, 59672 is the Modified Julian Day for systems that keep time as the number of seconds; 22-04-03 is year-month-day; 15:21:32 is hour:minute:second. 
   50 is DST flag that gives advance notice of the transitions to and from daylight saving time. 
   First 0 is LS flag that gives notice of the imminent occurrence of a leap second. 
   The second 0 is H parameter which gives an estimate of the health of the time server. 
   721.9 gives the time advance in milliseconds. 
   UTC indicates coordinated universal time. 
   \n is line-changing operator. 

5. [SYN] means synchronization. This is the first step in TCP 3-way handshake as the client is trying to build communication with the server.

6. [ACK] means acknowledgement. It is sent to signify the receipt of former message.

7. [FIN] is a connection termination request indicating that one of the device would like to stop further information transmission through the internet.

8. The nc client initiated the closing of TCP connection since the [FIN] packet is sent from IP address indicating nc client to IP address indicating server.

===== HTTP =====
1. Based on my count, 36 TCP connections were opened.

2. 5  192.168.124.128  45.79.89.123  HTTP  GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
   This frame indicates a packet of HTTP protocol which uses GET to request for the homepage index.html.
   
3. 11  192.168.124.128  45.79.89.123  HTTP GET /jeff_square_head.jpg HTTP/1.1
   This frame indicates a packet of HTTP protocol which uses GET to request for the photograph jeff_square_head.jpg.
   
===== QUESTIONS =====
1. Sometimes red lines pop out in the output of Wireshark. What is the difference between red ones and normal ones?

2. For the second part of assignment, why is there only TCP or HTTP protocols displayed? Can we see IP protocol in the output of Wireshark?
