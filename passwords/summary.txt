Analysis
My time per hash computed didn't change significantly between phases. This is because number of hashes computed is positively proportional to total time spent. If more iterations were necessary to crack the password, more hashes will be computed while total time increases.
My time per password crack changed signifcantly between phases 1,3 and phase 2 by a factor of 2. Phase 1 does not differ much from phase 3 since they both implement one iteration through the file of words to crack the password. It takes two iterations for phase 2 to complete one crack since passwords are combinations of two components.
Suppose I wanted to precompute all hashes for each possible password, it takes about 267733*(32+16+32)=21418640 bytes for phase 1 and phase 3. Phase 2 demands memory of about 267733*267733*(32+16+32)=5.73E12 bytes.
If passwords were stored in plaintext, attackers can simply try seize the list of account information and gain full control of other people's account. Hashing makes it impossible to retrieve orginal texts at any reasonable amount of time for a hacker. Since many people like to include personal information like date of birth in their passwords, hashing prevents leak of personal information in a simple way. Since hashing is really input sensitive, it will be almost impossible for hackers to guess passwords based on some known information.
